    <p>My name is Persan Aaron Antoine
        <br>
        I come from the village of Eggleston
        <br>
        My future career is a software developer/business person,this career choice was made as I had an interest to create things 
        things never seen before or at the very least to help create them  
        <br>
        Hence why I felt that this career would be a great career to pursue to fulfill this desire to create
        I also felt that the challenge of pursuing this career could be hard but it would help me to get out of my 
        comfort zone and learn something that I was interested in.
