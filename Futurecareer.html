        My future career is a software developer/business person,this career choice was made as I had an interest to create<br>
        things never seen before or at the very least to help create them .
        <br>
        Hence why I felt that this career would be a great career to pursue in order to fulfill this desire.<br>
        There were doubts as to why I should not go for this career as it is known to be a very challenging career <br>
         but I had to change my mentality , and so far it has helped me get out of my <br>
        comfort zone and learn a skill that I'm very much interested in.
